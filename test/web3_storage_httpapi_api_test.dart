    // Retrieve HTTP headers regarding a CAR
    //
    // This method is useful for doing a dry run of a call to `/car/{cid}`. Because it only returns HTTP header information, it is far more lightweight and can be used to get only the metadata about the given CAR file without retrieving a whole payload in the body of the HTTP response.

    // Upload a CAR
    //
    // Upload a [CAR](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) (Content Addressable aRchive) file and store the [IPFS DAG](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/) (Directed Acyclic Graph) it contains.  See the [Working with Content Archives guide](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/work-with-car-files) for details on creating CARs and splitting them into chunks for upload using the [carbites JavaScript API](https://github.com/nftstorage/carbites), [command line tool](https://github.com/nftstorage/carbites-cli/), or [Go library](https://github.com/alanshaw/go-carbites).  Requests to this endpoint have a maximum payload size of 100MB but partial DAGs are supported, so multiple CAR files with the same root but with different sub-trees can be sent. This enables uploading of files that are bigger than the maximum payload size.  Note that only one CAR can be uploaded at a time, and only CAR files are accepted. This is in contrast to [`/upload`](#operation/post-upload), which can upload multiple files at once and accepts both CAR files and files from the client.  You can also provide a name for the file using the header `X-NAME`, but be sure to encode the filename first. For example `LICENSE–MIT` should be sent as `LICENSE%E2%80%93MIT`.

    // Upload and store one or more files
    //
    // Store files using web3.storage. You can upload either a single file or multiple files.  Send the POST request with one of the following: - a single file, with a single blob/file object as the body - multiple files, as `FormData` with `Content-Disposition` headers for each part to specify filenames and the request header `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`  Requests to this endpoint have a maximum payload size of 100MB. To upload larger files, see the documentation for the `/car` endpoint.  You can also provide a name for the file using the header `X-NAME`, but be sure to encode the filename first. For example `LICENSE–MIT` should be sent as `LICENSE%E2%80%93MIT`.
